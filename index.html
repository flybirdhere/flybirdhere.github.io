Question 1
Overview: As an IT Support Specialist, it’s important that you fully grasp how networks work. You may need to troubleshoot different aspects of a network, so it’s important that you know how everything fits together. This assignment will help you demonstrate this knowledge by describing how networks function.

What You’ll Do: In your own words, describe what happens at every step of our network model, when a node on one network establishes a TCP connection with a node on another network. You can assume that the two networks are both connected to the same router.

Your submission must include a detailed explanation of the following:

- Physical layer
- Data link layer
- Network layer
- Transport layer
- MAC address
- IP address
- TCP port
- Checksum check
- Routing table
- TTL




Five-Layer Network Model

Physical layer sends and receives signals on the physical wire or antenna to transmit the bits found in frames then the data link layer is used to determine if the frame received by the host contains the host’s MAC address. If it does, the data is forwarded up to the Network layer. When receiving data, network layer is used to determine if the packet received by the host contains the host’s IP address. If it does, the data is forwarded up to the Transport layer. The Transport layer establishes the connection between applications running on different hosts. It uses TCP for reliable connections and UDP for fast connections. It keeps track of the processes running in the applications above it by assigning port numbers to them and uses the Network layer to access the TCP/IP network, and the Application layer is where applications requiring network communications live.

**Physical Layer** 
Is the physical connection between the sender and the receiver. It includes all the hardware devices (computers, modems, and hubs) and physical media (cables and satellites). This layer specifies the type of connection and the electrical signals, radio waves, or light pulses that pass through it. 

**Data Link Layer** 
Is responsible for moving a message from one computer to the next computer in the network path from the sender to the receiver. This layer has 3 functions:

1. Control the physical layer by deciding when to transmit messages over the media. 
2. Format the messages by indicating where they start and end. 
3. Detects and corrects any errors that have occurred during transmission. 

**Network Layer**
This layer performs the following functions: 

1. Routing, selecting the next computer to which the message should be sent. 
2. Find the address of that computer if it doesn’t already know it. 

**Transport Layer**
It performs two functions: 

1. It is responsible for linking the application layer software to the network and establishing end-to-end connections between the sender and receiver when such connections are needed. 
2. It breaks long messages into several smaller messages to make them easier to transmit. 
3. Detect lost messages and request that they be resent. 

Application Layer
This is the application software used by the network user. With this layer the user defines what messages are sent over the network. Examples of this layer are the internet explorer and web pages.
